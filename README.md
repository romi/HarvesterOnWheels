# HarvesterOnWheels

**Harvesting mixed salads is a painful task when done by hands and there are existing tools to ease the cutting of these plants. Hacking on this, we propose to build a mixed salad harvester. We make the blade larger so that it can harvest all salads in one pass on the the culture bed and we put the machine on wheels so that it is easy to handle.**
